# TO-DO-LIST1
A to-do list is a simple tool that helps you keep track of tasks and activities.
It allows you to jot down what you need to do, mark tasks as completed when finished,
and easily clear or delete them once they're done. With a to-do list, you can organize your responsibilities,
see what's left to accomplish, and gain a sense of accomplishment as you check off completed tasks.
Whether it's for daily chores, work assignments, or personal goals, a to-do list keeps you organized and on top of your tasks.
